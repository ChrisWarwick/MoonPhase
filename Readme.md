**WARNING**: This is a work in progress.  I currently do not have 100% trust the results this script produces and further dev/debug is required...

Origin
--
The algorithms used here are PowerShell implementations of routines described in "Practical Astronomy with your Calculator or Spreadsheet"

Usage
--
Do not run this script.  There are some sample use cases for functions contained in **MoonPhase.ps1** in the script file.  Note that some of these contain hardcoded dates that really should be changed....
